# Project3

This is the final delivery of the Advanced Graphics Programming subject and this README contains all its documentation.

## Made by:
[Òscar Faura](https://github.com/ofaura)

[Dídac Romero](https://github.com/DidacRomero)

## Instructions of use

Camera Movement: W, A, S, D

Camera rotation: (Mouse) Left click & drag

Aside from the camera movement, we have an Imgui tab to control different aspects of the model viewer and to see information of OpenGL and our graphics context.

First, we have a text area were you can see the current FPS and information regarding the OpenGL version, renderer etc.

After that, we have a set of boxes in which we can set the movement speed, FOV (Field of View), nearplane, farplane and camera position.

After that we have a set of sections to use Bloom and SSAO but those will be covered further in the documentation. After these we have a Render Mode combobox to change the rendering mode. By clicking on the small arrow you can switch between these modes:

* Deferred Render
* Forward Render
* Albedo
* Depth
* Normals
* Position

Finally, we have a window with all the GLSL extensions listed, and the list can be navigated using the small bar on the right.

## Advanced Techniques
For this delivery we implemented Bloom and SSAO (Screen Space Ambient Oclusion).

### Bloom


### Screen space ambient occlusion (SSAO)




We are currently testing this README and its "Webpage" capabilities.
